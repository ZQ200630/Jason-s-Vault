## 家庭

There are 11 people in my family. My grand parents, my parents, my anut and uncle, my two brothers and me.

I'm the middle child: one of my brother is 8 months older, and another is 1 year younger than me.

My immediate family is quite small, because I'm an only child.Both my dad and my mom are one of three children, so I have a lot of cousins, who are kind of like my brothers and sister.

I'm very close to my family. My college and my home are in the same city. We have lunch together every weekend. My father always cooks something delicious. We don't see my other relatives that much, may be in spring festival...

## 居住

外部：位置，地点，层数

内部：空间大小？舒适程度？方便程度？

I live in an studio apartment with my 3 dormmate on the top floor of a seven-storey building. It just has one main room with a small toilet. The flat is not spacious. There are four Loft beds with desks, which save the space. I can't say it's cosy because there is no air conditioner. We'll be crazy in summer and winter. But it's convenient since it's in our campus.

I live in a shared house. I have four flatmates.

I live by myself.

I live in a very lively area just south of the city center. There are lots of cafes, shops, and places to go.

## 业余活动

In my free time, I enjoy playing badmiton. I play it once or twice a week at the stadium in our campus. Sometimes I play with my brother, sometimes I play with my friends. I started playing badmiton when I was ten. My parents got me into it because they wonder me to have a balanced development. At first I feel it's too hard. While when I got it,  I found that it is a good exercise to fit body.

## Home town

I live in WuHan. It's a huge, bustling, international city. It's the provincial capital of HUBEI province and it is famous for its landmarks such as the West Lake and Yellow Crane Tower. It's also well-known for its food, of course, like hot dry noodles etc. I've lived there about 20 years since I was borned.  I love living in WuHan. It's got such a rich culture and there's always something interesting going on.

However, the cost of living is really high. That can be quite stressful because you're always thinking about money and how to make ends meet. Air quality can be an issue, particularly in the summer.

WuHan has changed a lot in the last twenty years. It's much more international and much more expensive than it used to be. However, the soul of the city is still there. WuHan will always be WuHan.

I could rember ten years ago when WuHan was elected as the National Civilized City. The slogen is WuHan different Everyday.

Let's hope there's more action in the second half. 15 minutes to get a cuppa and a pie - or do you fancy a quick one  - 喝茶喝闷酒
