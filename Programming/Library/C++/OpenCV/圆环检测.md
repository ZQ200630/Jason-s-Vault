# 圆环检测

```c
vector<Vec3f> circles;
HoughCircles(gray, circles, HOUGH_GRADIENT, 1,
             gray.rows/16,  
             100, 30, 1, 30)
//gray: Input image (grayscale).
//circles: A vector that stores sets of 3 values: xc,yc,r for each detected circle.
//HOUGH_GRADIENT: Define the detection method. Currently this is the only one available in OpenCV.
//dp = 1: The inverse ratio of resolution.
//min_dist = gray.rows/16: Minimum distance between detected centers.
//param_1 = 200: Upper threshold for the internal Canny edge detector.
//param_2 = 100*: Threshold for center detection.
//min_radius = 0: Minimum radius to be detected. If unknown, put zero as default.
//max_radius = 0: Maximum radius to be detected. If unknown, put zero as default.
