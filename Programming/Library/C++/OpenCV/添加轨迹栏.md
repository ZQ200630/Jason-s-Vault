```c
createTrackbar( TrackbarName, "Linear Blend", &alpha_slider, alpha_slider_max, on_trackbar );
//Our Trackbar has a label TrackbarName
//The Trackbar is located in the window named Linear Blend
//The Trackbar values will be in the range from 0 to alpha_slider_max (the minimum limit is always zero).
//The numerical value of Trackbar is stored in alpha_slider
//Whenever the user moves the Trackbar, the callback function on_trackbar is called

static void on_trackbar( int, void* )
{
   alpha = (double) alpha_slider/alpha_slider_max ;
   beta = ( 1.0 - alpha );
   addWeighted( src1, alpha, src2, beta, 0.0, dst);
   imshow( "Linear Blend", dst );
}
